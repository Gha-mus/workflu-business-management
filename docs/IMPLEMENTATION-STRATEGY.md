# WorkFlu Complete Compliance Implementation Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation strategy to achieve full compliance with the workflow_reference.json across all 10 business stages. This implementation addresses critical gaps and ensures exact adherence to the specified business rules.

## Current State Analysis
- **COMPLETED**: Mobile-responsive navigation, Stage 8 governance backbone
- **PARTIAL**: Basic implementations exist for most stages but lack full compliance
- **CRITICAL GAPS**: Stage 5 (Operating Expenses) missing entirely, Stage 7 (Revenues) incomplete, validation rules insufficient across all stages

## Implementation Priority Order
1. Stage 10 (Settings) - Foundation for all other stages
2. Stage 1 (Working Capital) - Core financial foundation
3. Stage 2 (Purchases) - Business core operations
4. Stage 3 (Warehouse) - Inventory management foundation
5. Stage 5 (Operating Expenses) - Complete new implementation
6. Stage 6 (Sales) - Revenue generation
7. Stage 7 (Revenues) - Financial completion
8. Stage 4 (Shipping) - Complex logistics
9. Stage 9 (Reports & KPIs) - Analytics and compliance
10. Stage 8 (Users & Permissions) - Final security layer

## Stage-by-Stage Implementation Requirements

### Stage 1: Working Capital - Full Compliance
**Critical Compliance Gaps:**

- Advance settlement workflows
- Split payment support (partial USD/ETB)

**Required Implementations:**
- Enhanced CapitalEntry schema with ETB tracking
- Automatic FX conversion service
- Entry linkage protection middleware
- Reverse/Reclass operation flows
- Manager approval workflow for sensitive operations

### Stage 2: Purchases - Full Compliance
**Critical Compliance Gaps:**
- Auto-creation of CapitalOut when "From Capital" funding selected

- Immutable price/weight after warehouse/shipping linkage
- Supplier return processing

**Required Implementations:**
- Enhanced Purchase schema with advance tracking
- Auto-CapitalOut creation middleware
- Advance settlement workflows
- Purchase-to-warehouse automation
- Linkage immutability constraints

### Stage 3: Warehouse - Full Compliance  
**Critical Compliance Gaps:**
- FIRST/FINAL warehouse distinction
- Status transition workflows (AWAITING_DECISION → READY_TO_SHIP/AWAITING_FILTER)

- Packing/preparation workflows with supplies consumption

**Required Implementations:**
- Enhanced WarehouseStock schema with status workflows
- Filtering cost redistribution logic
- Packing workflow with supplies integration

- Confirmation restrictions and inspection workflows

**Required Implementations:**
- Complete shipping schema (carriers, legs, costs, tracking)
- Multi-leg workflow management
- Commission and funding integration
- Landed cost calculation service
- Inspection and final warehouse transfer

### Stage 5: Operating Expenses - Complete Implementation
**Status: MISSING ENTIRELY**

**New Components Needed:**
- Complete Operating Expenses module
- Supplies inventory system  
- Labor tracking and allocation
- Rent and overhead allocation
- Expense-to-order cost assignment

### Stage 6: Sales - Full Compliance
**Critical Compliance Gaps:**
- Warehouse source enforcement (FIRST = non-clean only, FINAL = clean only)
- Single vs. multi-order support
- Returns validation and processing
- A/R receipts and customer payment tracking
- COGS calculation with proper cost basis

**Required Implementations:**
- Warehouse source validation middleware
- Multi-order sales workflow
- Returns processing system
- Customer payment tracking
- Enhanced COGS calculation

### Stage 7: Revenues - Complete Implementation
**Status: INCOMPLETE**
**Required Implementation:**
- Revenue ledger with all transaction types

- Balance protection middleware

### Stage 8: Users & Permissions - Enhanced RBAC
**Current: Basic role system implemented**
**Required Enhancements:**
- Multi-role assignments per user
- Warehouse scoping for inventory access

- Export functionality for all data types
- Real-time metric calculations
- Historical trend analysis

**Required Implementation:**
- Complete KPI calculation engine
- All specified reports (15+ report types)
- Export system for Excel/PDF/CSV

### Stage 10: Settings - Central Configuration
**Critical Gaps:**
- Central FX rate enforcement across all stages
- Configuration toggles for business rules
- Numbering schemes for all entities
- Draft/publish workflow for settings
- Configuration snapshots and rollback

## Global Requirements Implementation

### Core Business Rules Enforcement
1. **Central FX Rate**: All ETB→USD conversions use single source
2. **Linked Entry Protection**: Cannot delete entries tied to operations
3. **Negative Balance Controls**: Configurable prevention with approval overrides
