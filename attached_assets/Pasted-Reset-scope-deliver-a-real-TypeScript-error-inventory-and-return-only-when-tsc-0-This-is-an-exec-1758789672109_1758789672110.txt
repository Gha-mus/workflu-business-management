Reset scope: deliver a real TypeScript error inventory and return only when tsc = 0

This is an execution order. No refactors, no new features, no claims, no partial work. Do not return until TypeScript = 0 errors with proof.

1) Freeze and report
	•	Stop all refactors immediately. Focus only on making npx tsc --noEmit pass.
	•	Run and attach these artifacts:
	1.	Full compiler log

npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false | tee artifacts/tsc-full.txt


	2.	Errors by file (top N)

npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false \
  | awk -F'(' '/error TS[0-9]+:/{print $1}' \
  | sed 's/ *$//' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | tee artifacts/tsc-by-file.txt


	3.	Errors by code (TS2339, TS2769, …)

npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false \
  | grep -o 'TS[0-9]\+' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | tee artifacts/tsc-by-code.txt


	4.	Repo state (so I can verify what changed):

git rev-parse HEAD > artifacts/commit.txt
git status --porcelain > artifacts/status.txt
git diff --stat > artifacts/diffstat.txt



2) Fix to green — scope and rules
	•	Scope: Only compile errors. No architectural moves, no schema changes, no “cleanup”, no renames.
	•	Rules:
	•	No any, no @ts-ignore, no silencing.
	•	Unify enum imports to a single source (shared/enums/**). Replace string literals with enum members only when types line up (no hacks).
	•	Drizzle types: align calls to the schema in shared/schema.ts. If a property name differs, fix the code (not the type with casts).
	•	If a value comes from DB as string, add narrowing/validation to convert to the enum safely.

3) Execution order (batches)
	•	Batch A — Storage layer (highest impact): Fix compile errors in server/storage.ts and server/core/storage.ts until both are 0 errors.
	•	Batch B — Route/service call sites: Fix errors caused by the storage types you just corrected.
	•	Batch C — Remaining files: Resolve the rest (group by error code for speed: TS2769 → TS2339 → TS2345/TS2322).

After each batch:
	•	Re-run npx tsc --noEmit and update the three artifacts (full, by-file, by-code).

4) Acceptance criteria (do not return until all are true)
	•	npx tsc --noEmit → exit 0 (attach updated artifacts).
	•	npm run build → success.
	•	No any/@ts-ignore added.
	•	Short change list (paths touched), and a one-paragraph note per tricky fix (enum/source-of-truth, Drizzle call pattern, or schema alignment).

Return only with the four artifacts, the change list, and confirmation that TypeScript errors = 0.
