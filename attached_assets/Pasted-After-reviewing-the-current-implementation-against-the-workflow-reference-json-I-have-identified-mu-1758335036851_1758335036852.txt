After reviewing the current implementation against the workflow_reference.json, I have identified multiple gaps and missing details that need to be corrected. Please carefully read and address every single point below, from the smallest details to the largest. All modifications should be implemented with the assistance of OpenAI to ensure full compliance.

üîé Detailed Missing Points by Stage

Stage 1: Working Capital

Missing notifications/alerts for low balance or negative balance.

Missing ability to split one capital payment across multiple orders (currently only single reference_id supported).

Ensure strict amount-equals-payment validation is enforced.

Stage 2: Purchases

Missing supplier notes and country of purchase fields.

Missing supplier quality grading integration.

Missing notifications/alerts for overdue supplier advances.

Multi-currency support is limited to single currency, should support flexible USD/ETB entry and historical FX storage.

No explicit return handling for purchases.

Stage 3: Warehouse

Missing notifications/alerts (e.g., orders waiting for filtering more than X days).

Missing detailed supplier-level filtering reports (yield %, clean vs non-clean by supplier).

Ensure automatic cost redistribution logic is fully validated and tested.

Stage 4: Shipping

Arrival costs currently support only broker + delivery. Missing storage and inland transport costs.

Missing alerts (shipment arrived but not inspected, missing arrival costs, weight mismatch).

Missing settlement workflow for inspection differences (accept, claim, return, discount).

Missing commission capture validation when funded from capital.

Stage 5: Operating Expenses

Supplies (cartons, tape, labels) are currently only tracked as direct expenses.

Missing supply inventory management system (purchase supplies first, then deduct during packing).

Missing consumption audit reports.

Stage 6: Sales

Invoices currently support only one order. Missing multi-order invoice support with explicit split logic.

Missing overdue receivables notifications/alerts.

Returns are not properly implemented ‚Äî must return to the original order and warehouse.

Enforce strict warehouse source rules (FIRST = non-clean only, FINAL = clean only).

Stage 7: Revenues

Revenue ledger implemented, but missing:

Proper display of dual balances (Accounting Revenue vs Withdrawable Balance).

Missing transfer fee recording into Operating Expenses during reinvestment.

Reinvestment workflow should create triple impact entries (Revenue Ledger: -ReinvestOut -TransferFee, Working Capital: +CapitalIn, Operating Expenses: +TransferFee).

Stage 8: User Management & RBAC

Missing ‚Äúdeny overrides‚Äù rule when multiple roles conflict.

Missing sensitive change policies (one-time edits, ¬±5% tolerance, mandatory manager approval).

Missing optional visibility controls (hide/show cost and margin data for specific users).

Stage 9: Reports

Reports exist but missing:

Period summaries (monthly/quarterly/annual).

Currency variance reports (FX impact on capital and revenues).

DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) calculation and report.

Alerts for anomalies (unexpected losses, overdue balances, unusual capital withdrawals).

Stage 10: Settings

Missing Draft ‚Üí Publish workflow for configuration changes.

Missing Snapshot/Restore system for settings (backup and rollback).

Missing alerts on FX rate changes when central exchange rate is updated.

üìä Summary

The system covers the basic workflows but is missing many critical details.

Current coverage is about 70‚Äì75% compliant, not 100% as previously reported.

The missing items are mostly related to: alerts/notifications, advanced reporting, supply inventory, reinvestment accounting, sensitive change policies, and configuration governance.

üöÄ Required Action

Please:

Implement all the missing features listed above in every stage.

Validate each modification against workflow_reference.json.

Work with OpenAI integration to review, validate, and automatically test compliance after each change.

Provide a new compliance report that proves every stage (1‚Äì10) is fully aligned, with no gaps left.

‚úÖ This message contains every missing detail from the workflow. Nothing should be skipped, even the smallest features (like alerts or tolerance policies).
