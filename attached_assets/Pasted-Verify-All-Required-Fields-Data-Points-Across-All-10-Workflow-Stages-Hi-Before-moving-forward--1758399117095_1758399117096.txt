Verify All Required Fields & Data Points Across All 10 Workflow Stages

Hi,

Before moving forward, I need you to double-check that every single required field, question, and data point across Stages 1 → 10 is fully implemented in both the UI and the API as per workflow_reference.json.

Please prepare a stage-by-stage checklist that covers:

Stage 1 — Working Capital

Stage 9 — Reports & KPIs

Stage 10 — Settings

What I need back:

A table per stage with:

Field / Data Point

Implemented? (Yes/No)

Where (UI + API)

Notes / Gaps

If any field or question is missing, implement it immediately and update the checklist.

Confirm by running validation tests per stage (inputs, calculations, validations, and cross-stage integration).

⚠️ Please do not skip or stop mid-way — the checklist must cover all 10 stages completely.
