Step 3 Verification — Provide Proof Pack & Unblock CI Build

You say enum normalization is complete. Do not proceed further until you provide the following proof pack and the CI build is green from a clean checkout.

A. Hard Proof (attach artifacts)
	1.	TypeScript proof
	•	Paste the raw command and exit code:

rm -rf node_modules .turbo .vite dist && npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false
echo $?


	•	Expected: Exit code 0 and no “error TS” lines.

	2.	Grep proof of no string literals for enums
	•	Run these (add patterns for every enum you touched) and paste outputs:

rg -n "['\"](draft|submitted|approved|rejected|closed)['\"]" --glob '!dist' || true
rg -n "['\"](pending|completed|cancelled|in_transit|received)['\"]" --glob '!dist' || true


	•	Expected: no matches in source files (matches only in test snapshots are OK).

	3.	Enum Inventory (table)
	•	Provide a markdown table listing each enum:
	•	Name | Values | Defined at (shared/enums/*.ts) | DB column(s) | Primary consumers (files)
	•	This must cover purchases, sales, warehouse, capital, quality, notifications, shipping, users, analytics.
	4.	Schema bindings
	•	Show the enum columns in Drizzle using the exact exported types (no string fallbacks). Paste the relevant snippets (before/after ok).
	5.	Boundary validation
	•	Show one example route per domain where Zod enum validation rejects invalid input with 400. Paste code & the failing test/log.

B. CI/CD Build Must Be Green

If the CI TypeScript build fails (even if runtime works), fix it now. From a clean checkout:

git clean -xdf
npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false
npm run build

	•	If failures are from AWS/SES or optional infra, solve it without hacks:
	•	Use conditional imports or environment guards.
	•	Provide minimal type stubs (e.g., types/aws-ses.d.ts) when the module is optional at compile-time.
	•	Do not re-introduce any or @ts-ignore.

C. Acceptance Criteria (must all pass)
	•	npx tsc --noEmit → 0 errors (proof attached).
	•	0 TS2769 occurrences related to enums (list the resolved call sites).
	•	0 inline enum string literals in source (grep proof attached).
	•	App builds and runs; no API contract changes.
	•	Enum Inventory table delivered.

Do not return until all of the above are attached. If anything is blocking, name the blocker, file path, and your concrete fix plan.
