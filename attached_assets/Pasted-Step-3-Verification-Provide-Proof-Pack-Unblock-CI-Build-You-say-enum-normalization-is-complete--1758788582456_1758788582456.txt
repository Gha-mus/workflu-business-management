Step 3 Verification — Provide Proof Pack & Unblock CI Build

You say enum normalization is complete. Do not proceed further until you provide the following proof pack and the CI build is green from a clean checkout.

A. Hard Proof (attach artifacts)

TypeScript proof

Paste the raw command and exit code:

rm -rf node_modules .turbo .vite dist && npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false
echo $?


Expected: Exit code 0 and no “error TS” lines.

Grep proof of no string literals for enums

Run these (add patterns for every enum you touched) and paste outputs:

rg -n "['\"](draft|submitted|approved|rejected|closed)['\"]" --glob '!dist' || true
rg -n "['\"](pending|completed|cancelled|in_transit|received)['\"]" --glob '!dist' || true


Expected: no matches in source files (matches only in test snapshots are OK).

Enum Inventory (table)

Provide a markdown table listing each enum:

Name | Values | Defined at (shared/enums/*.ts) | DB column(s) | Primary consumers (files)

This must cover purchases, sales, warehouse, capital, quality, notifications, shipping, users, analytics.

Schema bindings

Show the enum columns in Drizzle using the exact exported types (no string fallbacks). Paste the relevant snippets (before/after ok).

Boundary validation

Show one example route per domain where Zod enum validation rejects invalid input with 400. Paste code & the failing test/log.

B. CI/CD Build Must Be Green

If the CI TypeScript build fails (even if runtime works), fix it now. From a clean checkout:

git clean -xdf
npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false
npm run build


If failures are from AWS/SES or optional infra, solve it without hacks:

Use conditional imports or environment guards.

Provide minimal type stubs (e.g., types/aws-ses.d.ts) when the module is optional at compile-time.

Do not re-introduce any or @ts-ignore.

C. Acceptance Criteria (must all pass)

npx tsc --noEmit → 0 errors (proof attached).

0 TS2769 occurrences related to enums (list the resolved call sites).

0 inline enum string literals in source (grep proof attached).

App builds and runs; no API contract changes.

Enum Inventory table delivered.

Do not return until all of the above are attached. If anything is blocking, name the blocker, file path, and your concrete fix plan.
