Complete Fix of All Remaining TypeScript Errors and Pending Tasks

Message:

Hi Team,

We’ve already made solid progress reducing the TypeScript compilation errors, but there are still ~2,000+ errors remaining across the codebase (mainly in server/storage.ts, server/core/storage.ts, and some client-side files).

I need you to systematically finish fixing ALL remaining errors until the project compiles cleanly with:

npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck


showing 0 errors.

Here are the exact priorities and tasks you must complete:

1. Server-Side Errors

server/core/storage.ts (187 errors):

Resolve property access errors (Property 'X' does not exist on type '{}').

Fix "Object is of type 'unknown'" issues by adding proper type guards or refining schema types.

Correct type assignment mismatches (string | null vs string | undefined).

server/storage.ts (226 errors):

Ensure all schema property mismatches (like entryId, businessContext, severity) are resolved.

Verify all imports are complete and consistent with shared/schema.ts.

Audit function signatures and update calls to match expected parameters.

2. Client-Side Errors

Resolve empty API response types ({}) in Reports.tsx and DocumentManagement.tsx.

Replace all any or {} usages with proper typed interfaces from shared/schema.ts.

Ensure consistent typing for API hooks and response handling.

3. Shared Schema & Types

Verify all missing type definitions (e.g., FinancialMetric, ShipmentLeg, SalesReturn, userWarehouseScopes) are fully defined and imported everywhere they’re used.

Consolidate type usage so client and server both use the same shared types instead of duplicating.

4. Audit & Logging

Fix all AuditContext vs ChangeRecord mismatches (e.g., businessContext, severity).

Verify auditOperation calls use the correct argument count (9, not 10).

Ensure all critical business operations (capital entries, warehouse movements, sales, purchases, etc.) are logged consistently.

5. Final Checks

Run npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck after each batch of fixes to confirm progress.

Continue until there are 0 TypeScript errors remaining across the entire project.

Do not leave partial fixes — the codebase must fully compile cleanly.

✅ Acceptance Criteria:

Zero TypeScript errors across backend and frontend.

Consistent schemas and types with no mismatches.

Audit system fully correct (AuditContext vs ChangeRecord separation).

End-to-end tests run without compilation errors.

All requested tasks in previous iterations are fully completed.

⚠️ Important: Please make sure not to stop midway. The project will only be accepted once the TypeScript error count is zero and all tasks are marked complete.
