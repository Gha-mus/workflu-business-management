I noticed that the new purchase I created is not appearing in the Purchases list and was instead handled as a "Pending Approval." This logic does not match the workflow we defined. Let me clarify the correct behavior so you can adjust the implementation accordingly:

🔹 Purchases

Direct Recording

When we create a purchase, it should be recorded immediately and directly in the database.

Purchases must not be blocked or hidden under "Pending Approval."

Approval Logic

Approval is only required if someone tries to modify an already existing purchase record (for example, changing supplier, weight, unit price, or total amount after it has been created).

New purchases = always accepted immediately, no approval step.

Integration with Warehouse

Every purchase line (supplier, quantity in kg, price, etc.) must directly appear as a row in the First Warehouse view for evaluation.

🔹 First Warehouse

Initial Status

Each purchase appears as a line under its supplier in the First Warehouse.

The warehouse team must decide for each line:

✅ Clean → The goods go directly into “Ready in First Warehouse” (eligible for shipping).

🟠 Filter/Cleaning → The goods go into “Awaiting Filter.”

After Filtering

Staff will enter:

Clean Output (kg) → Added automatically to First Warehouse (ready for shipping).

Non-Clean Output (kg) → Remains permanently in First Warehouse as "Non-Clean" (to be sold as-is).

Loss/Discarded (kg) → Recorded as system loss.

Approval in Warehouse

No approval is required for normal evaluation (Clean vs Filter).

Approval is only triggered if someone tries to manually change warehouse quantities after the system has already registered them.

🔑 Summary

Purchases: Always recorded immediately, never stuck as “pending.”

Approvals: Only when modifying existing purchases or manually altering warehouse stock.

Warehouse Flow: Purchases → First Warehouse rows → Marked Clean or Awaiting Filter → Outputs handled accordingly (Clean / Non-Clean / Loss).

Please update the implementation to reflect this exact workflow. Purchases should appear instantly, flow into the First Warehouse, and follow the clean/filter/loss process there.
