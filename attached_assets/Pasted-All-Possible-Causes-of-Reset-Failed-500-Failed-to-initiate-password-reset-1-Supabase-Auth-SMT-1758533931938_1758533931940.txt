All Possible Causes of Reset Failed 500: "Failed to initiate password reset"

1) Supabase Auth / SMTP Settings

Incorrect SMTP settings

Host must be: smtp.gmail.com

Best port: 587 (not 465)

Username = full email: addworkflu@gmail.com

Password = App Password (not your regular password)

Sender email should ideally be the same as above.

After editing, click Save and then test again.

Supabase rate limit issue

If you test multiple times within minutes, Supabase blocks sending and returns an error (sometimes shows 500).

Fix: wait 5–10 minutes and try once only, or add a message to users explaining the send limit.

Incorrect Site URL / Redirect URLs

Go to: Authentication → URL Configuration.

Site URL = your current app link.

Add your reset page link in Redirect URLs (e.g. https://<your-repl>.repl.co/reset).

If the link isn’t listed, Supabase rejects the request → causes the error.

Gmail SMTP warning

It’s normal to see the orange warning. Gmail works, but messages may go to Spam and daily limits apply.

2) Backend / API Usage Errors

Wrong client usage

✅ Correct:

const client = supabaseClient();
await client.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email, { redirectTo: RESET_URL });


❌ Wrong: using supabaseAdmin() for this operation.

Error handling

Supabase may return error (429 or 400), but your code converts it to 500.

Fix: log the real error (error.message, error.status).

Missing or incorrect ENV keys

Make sure in Replit you have:

SUPABASE_URL

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

A small typo in the key name makes the connection fail → 500.

Working on the wrong project/environment

Ensure the URL and KEY match the same Supabase project where SMTP is configured.

3) User / Provider Settings

Email login not enabled

Go to: Authentication → Sign In / Providers and enable Email.

Email confirmation required

If the system enforces email confirmation and the user isn’t verified, reset may fail.

Test directly in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users → click Reset password for the same email.

User doesn’t exist

If the email is unregistered or typed wrong, some code may return a generic 500 instead of 404.

4) Email Layer

Invalid App Password

If lost or copied incorrectly, generate a new one and paste it in Supabase SMTP.

Sender email different from username

Some providers reject emails sent from a different address.

Fix: use the same email as the username.

Minimum interval between emails

If set to 60 seconds and you send faster, it may block.

5) Debugging Locations

Authentication → Logs (Supabase): check the real error (Rate limit, Bad SMTP, etc.).

Replit Console: shows exceptions.

Network tab in DevTools: see the actual response status from Supabase (400, 429, or 500).

✅ Checklist

Supabase → Emails → SMTP Settings:
Host = smtp.gmail.com, Port = 587, User/From = addworkflu@gmail.com, Password = App Password.

Supabase → URL Configuration:
Correct Site URL + Redirect URL.

Supabase → Providers:
Enable Email.

Replit Environment Variables:
SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are correct.

Restart the server to clear cache.

Try reset after 5–10 minutes.

If it still fails: copy the error message from Supabase Auth Logs or Network tab.
