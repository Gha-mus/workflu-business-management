I want to provide a very detailed clarification of what I mean by Filtering in the First Warehouse tab, so the concept is fully understood and implemented correctly.

1. Operational Filtering (Business Process)

This is the core warehouse operation that happens after a purchase is received into the First Warehouse.

Step 1 ‚Äì Arrival: Purchased goods arrive in the First Warehouse.

Step 2 ‚Äì Decision: Each lot must either:

Go directly to Ready to Ship (no filtering needed), OR

Go into Awaiting Filter (requires filtering before shipping).

Step 3 ‚Äì Execute Filter Button:

When I click this, the system should prompt me to enter the weights for:

Clean (usable, export quality)

Non-Clean (waste, to be sold locally at zero value)

The system validates that:

Clean + Non-Clean ‚â§ Original Purchased Weight

The system then:

Creates a Filter Record with details (Order ID, Supplier, Date, Clean/Non-Clean weights, Yield%).

Calculates the filter yield % = (Clean / Original) √ó 100.

Redistributes costs:

Clean weight retains all purchase cost allocations.

Non-Clean weight is valued at zero (goes to Local Sale).

Updates inventory:

Clean ‚Üí goes into Ready to Ship.

Non-Clean ‚Üí goes into Non-Clean / Local Sale.

üìå This is a business/operational workflow. It is NOT the same as just filtering/searching data in a table. It changes the inventory records and financial calculations.

2. Data Filtering / Search Tools (UI-level Filtering)

This is different ‚Äî it‚Äôs a tool for me as a user to find and view records inside the First Warehouse tab.

Examples of what I need:

By Supplier (see stock from one supplier)

By Date (see purchases/filters by a certain range)

By Order ID (track a specific order across filtering stages)

By Status (Awaiting Filter, Ready to Ship, Non-Clean, etc.)

By Quality/Category if relevant

üìå This does not modify inventory. It just helps me view and track. For example, I might filter the list to only see ‚ÄúAwaiting Filter‚Äù items, then use the Execute Filter button to process them.

3. How Both Connect Together

Operational Filtering = Actual process of splitting stock into Clean and Non-Clean, with cost/accounting updates.

UI Filtering (Search) = Allows me to quickly locate which items need filtering, which are already filtered, or which are ready to ship.

Both should exist in the First Warehouse tab to fully support the workflow.

‚úÖ Summary of Requirements

The Execute Filter button must be implemented to handle the operational filtering process exactly as described.

Add proper UI filtering/search tools (supplier, date, order ID, status) above the inventory table in First Warehouse.

Ensure that the operational filtering process automatically updates inventory status and costs, while the UI filters remain purely for user convenience in navigating the records.
