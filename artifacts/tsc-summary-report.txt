SERVER/STORAGE.TS SPECIFIC:
- Total errors in server/storage.ts: 199
- File appears 199+ times in error output
- Top error locations: lines 7515, 12839, 12834, and many others

CROSS-FILE IMPACT:
- Errors span multiple services: 
  - supplyInventoryService.ts
  - userWarehouseScopesService.ts  
  - warehouseEnhancementService.ts
  - approvalWorkflowService.ts
  - Various route files
  - Core storage files

KEY FINDINGS:
1. The LSP "No diagnostics found" result was INCORRECT
2. Actual TypeScript compilation reveals 683+ total errors
3. server/storage.ts contains 199 confirmed errors
4. This contradicts the claimed "0 TypeScript errors" achievement
